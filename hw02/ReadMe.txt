This directory includes two programs. The ledBLINK.py program controls 4 LEDs
(two internal, two external) with 4 push buttons. The etch_a_sketch_withgpio.py 
program is a simple etch_a_sketch game where the position is controlled with
push buttons instead of the keyboard. The instructions for this program are
printed when you run it. No additional add-ons need to be installed.
