This is the completed homework 6. The files to look at are 'reset.sh', 'text.sh' and 'etch-a-sketch.c'.

I edited the rotate command in 'reset.sh' so that the display would rotate an image or video 90 degrees.

I two things in 'text.sh'. The first 'convert' command was edited so that it would display my name on the white background. 
The second convert command wrote the text 'tux' on the 'tux.png' image. The resulting image is 'append_label.jpg'. In order
to see the first image (my name written on a white background), you will have to comment out the second convert command.

I have not used pygame before so I did not run this on the display

The final file to look at is 'etch-a-sketch.c'. I did two things to improve the program. I changed the code so that
it will take three user input values used for the red, green, and blue values that control the color of the 'etch-a-sketch.c'
trail. I also changed the width of the etch-a-sketch trail. My plan was to change the code so that the etch-a-sketch trail didn't
have any random spaces in it. If you are reading this, that means I was unable to fix it before you graded it and will have to 
accept a 9/10.
