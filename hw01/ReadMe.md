I believe I have completed items 1-5 correctly

For item 6, my code creates a simple etch-a-sketch game based
on keyboard commands. The code prints out more directions when you run it.
I coded in python and used the ncurses import. Ncurses was already present 
on my board so I didn't have to install anything. I didn't include an 
install.sh file because of this.
