These are the deliverables for homework 7. The important items to look at are "ledBLINK.py", "GPIO_mem_map.c", "gpio_test.c", and "Homework 7 report"  in the gpio_test folder.
The "ledBLINK.py" program maps a gpio input to an output using interrupts. The "GPIO_mem_map.c" program uses mmap() and maps a gpio input to an output. 
The "gpio_test.c" file is used by the kernel to map a gpio input to an output.
