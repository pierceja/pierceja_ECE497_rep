This is the completed homework 5. The files to look at are in the folder "realtime".

The two files I changed are the matrixLED.js and matrixLED.css file. I changed the matrixLED.js file so that the LEDs on the website and LED matrix will change color depending on how
many times they have been clicked (green for 1 click, orange for 2, red for 3, off for 4). I added a red and orange section in the matrixLED.css file so that the LEDs on the website
could be displayed as red or orange.
